    <h1>Welcome to the Final Page</h1>
    <p>Congratulations! This means you have made it to the final piece of the 
	puzzle!</p>
	<p>You passed through the rap, the roblox experience, and finally you get to 
	your REAL gift!<br>Sorry if this all seems tedious, but I had to make sure 
	this whole thing was automated in the event that I wouldnt be able to attend 
	vc! (i also had to make it hard, cant have you getting a gift without 
	working for it) :P<br>anyway, here's the final puzzle<br></p>

	<p>What you see here is an incomplete link to a minecraft world. The link 
	contains a few characters which are missing! This may seem similar but the 
	way you go about solving this is quite different!</p>
	<p>Each of the missing characters represent a page in a book, or a 
	paragraph, letter, etc.<br>To find these missing characters, you must sift 
	through the required information, find the region according to the clue, and 
	obtain the missing character.</p>
	<p>Good luck!</p>
	<p><strong><span class="auto-style1">W:</span> </strong>Within The book 
	named "Pride and Prejudice" written by Jane Austen, there is a specific 
	chapter which reads out<strong> "Within a short walk of longbourn lived a 
	family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate." </strong>The 
	number of this chapter in<strong> roman numeral form </strong>corresponds to 
	the missing character. (LOWERCASE)</p>
	<p><strong><span class="auto-style1">X:</span>&nbsp; This ones a little 
	different. </strong>The Invention of penicillin was one of the most 
	revolutionary steps for medicine. The letter here represents <strong>TWO</strong> 
	characters. These two characters are <strong>NUMBERS</strong> and correspond 
	to the last two digits of the year in which penicillin was discovered.</p>
	<p><strong>Y:</strong> The number of limbs you have.</p>
	<p><strong>Z:</strong> The first letter of the <strong>name</strong> of the 
	currency used in the United States. (LOWERCASE)</p>
